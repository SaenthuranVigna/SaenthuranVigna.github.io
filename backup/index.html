              Passionate About Learning
            </h3>
            <p>
              I'm super passionate about learning, and my whole goal is to make
              learning more accessible for everyone. I believe everyone should
              have something they're passionate about and can learn. My mission
              is to help you make those ideas and dreams a reality, for

            <p>
              The way I see it, the world needs more dreamers and passionate
              people doing what they love. If money is the only thing standing
              in the way of someone chasing their dream, I'm all in to help
              remove that barrier. Sometimes, all it takes is finding the right
              opportunities, learning a bit, and having the passion to go for
              it.

              Your Journey from Idea to Build

            <p>
              My role in your journey is to equip you with the resources and
              knowledge you need to take that first step and learn the right
              things. After you bring your idea to life, there are two options:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I can drop off at that point, and you can continue building your
                idea without me.
              </li>
              <li>
                We can continue working together and set up a paid arrangement
                where I still provide value through coaching calls.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Whichever option you choose, all I ask is that you keep in touch.
              If everything goes according to plan, you'll be vastly successful,
              and I'd love to watch you grow and make your dreams a reality.

              "The Art of Coffee Chatting" is a series of virtual coffee calls
              with interesting people who have had unique journeys or are
              building something cool. If you want to be on the show and you

              </li>
              <li>
                You know someone who fits the above criteria that you think I

              generally. If you want a specific resource, template, or eBook,
              and it falls into one of the following categories, message me, and

                It has to be something general (valuable to a slightly larger

              </li>
              <li>
                It must not be time-sensitive (needs to be something that I can
                spend a reasonable amount of time on, so it's actually valuable
                for you)
